# Serverless Testing
Software Testing is a key part of any application development irrespective of the tools, frameworks or methodologies in use. This simple project is created to put up few examples on how to create Unit tests for Lambda functions using the Jest and other libraries.

Run the following command to run unit tests.

```
npm test
```

For initgration testing, make sure the project is deployed to AWS account. Update the `.env` with AWS region and API Gateway Endpoint. Refer the [sample.env](./sample.env) file for the required environment variables.

```
npm run test-integration
```
